ðŸ“Š Cardiovascular Disease Anomaly Detection
This project focuses on anomaly detection and analysis in a cardiovascular disease dataset using unsupervised learning techniques and deep learning-based autoencoders. The project includes feature engineering, visualization, model evaluation, and confusion matrix generation.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature engineering.

Feature Engineering: Adding derived features like BMI, age in years, and blood pressure difference.

Anomaly Detection Models:

Isolation Forest

One-Class SVM

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Autoencoder

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Visualization:

Distribution pie charts for categorical features.

Anomaly detection bar plots.

Confusion matrices in tabular form.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

TensorFlow/Keras
